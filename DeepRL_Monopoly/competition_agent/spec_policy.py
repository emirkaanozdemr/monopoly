"""Phase 2 — a policy built from SPEC.md, branch by branch.

Structure
---------
A **priority-ordered rule pipeline**, not a reconstruction of the teacher's
architecture. Rules are consulted in order; the first that returns an action
wins. Each rule is small, names the SPEC ids it implements, and is responsible
for exactly one decision family. The ordering encodes what the probes showed
about which considerations override which.

Every branch cites the SPEC rule that justifies it. Nothing here was derived
from the teacher's source or from `decide()`'s internals.

    forced        - only one legal action
    debt          - forced liquidation ordering            F1-F5
    auction       - ceiling + safety                       B1-B5, D1-D4
    jail          - post-roll exit choice                  G1-G5
